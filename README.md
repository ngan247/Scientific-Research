# Enhancing Blockchain Interoperability through Sidechain and VTK

## Description
We propose a blockchain interoperability based on sidechain solution to support cross-chain data transfer. Our sidechain is a decentralized oracle network, serving as a trustworthy intermediary among heterogeneous blockchains and the concept of a Valid Time Key (VTK) to enhance secure data access management and convenience.

This is the demo code of the transfer data function and Valid Time Key function of our cross-chain system.
